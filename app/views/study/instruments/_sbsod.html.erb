<h2>Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale</h2>
<p>This questionnaire consists of several statements about your spatial and navigational abilities, preferences, and experiences. After each statement, you should select a number to indicate your level of agreement with the statement. Select "1" if you strongly agree that the statement applies to you, "7" if you strongly disagree, or some number in between if your agreement is intermediate. Select "4" if you neither agree nor disagree.</p>
